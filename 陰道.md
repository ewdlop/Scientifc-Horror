Electron's spin = 1/2(in the unit of ℏ) by definition and it technically can be 1/2 + |ε1| + |ε2|i for some  |ε1|+|ε2| >= 0,  |ε1||ε2| >= 0, or |ε1|^n+|ε2|^n >= 0, ε1,ε2 ∈ R.

Ghost-like terms in Faddeev-Popov Ghosts, or cosmetical constant term in Einstein Field Equation.

~Too pretty to be true~.

Too ugly.
