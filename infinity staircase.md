# infinity staircase

```markdown
To create an **infinity staircase** using the **square root of \( z^n \)** function, and considering the idea of identifying the top and bottom of a surface, we can work through a mathematical construction.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Square Root of \( z^n \)**: 
   The function \( \sqrt{z^n} \) will give us a multi-valued function, because taking powers and roots in the complex plane introduces branch cuts. Specifically, \( z^n \) is a well-known function in complex analysis, and the square root of it will introduce square-root singularities and multi-valued behavior.

2. **Riemannian Surface**: 
   When considering a Riemannian surface, we want to model how distances are measured and how we can create a surface with a particular geometric structure. By taking a square root of a function like \( z^n \), we can create interesting shapes (e.g., spirals, loops, and infinite structures) in the complex plane.

3. **Identifying the Top and Bottom**: 
   To create the "infinity staircase," identifying the top and bottom will close the surface vertically, creating a cylindrical or toroidal structure. This surface will then allow for a continuous loop or path on the "staircase."

### Mathematical Construction Using \( \sqrt{z^n} \):

Let's begin by defining a surface where the points are parameterized by the complex variable \( z \). For simplicity, consider \( z \) to be on the unit circle in the complex plane, so that \( z = e^{i\theta} \) where \( \theta \) is the angular coordinate.

#### Step 1: Define the function
We want to take the square root of \( z^n \). Let \( z = e^{i\theta} \), so we have:

\[
f(z) = \sqrt{z^n} = \sqrt{e^{in\theta}} = e^{in\theta / 2}
\]

This describes a curve on the complex plane that wraps around the unit circle at a rate that is scaled by \( n/2 \). The multi-valued nature of this function comes from the fact that the angle \( \theta \) can take multiple values, leading to multiple branches of the square root.

#### Step 2: Parameterization of the staircase
Now, consider that you want the surface to represent an "infinity staircase." You can achieve this by letting the angle \( \theta \) increase linearly, so we have:

\[
\theta = t \quad \text{(where \( t \) increases without bound)}
\]

Thus, the parameterized curve becomes:

\[
f(t) = e^{in t / 2}
\]

This defines a spiral in the complex plane that increases in angle and can "ascend" continuously. The \( n/2 \) factor ensures that the curve winds more or less frequently, depending on \( n \).

#### Step 3: Identifying the top and bottom
If we wish to identify the top and bottom (i.e., glue the top and bottom), we create a cylindrical or toroidal structure. One way to achieve this is by defining a coordinate in the vertical direction, say \( y \), that "loops" as \( t \) increases.

Let the parameterization be:

\[
z(t) = e^{in t / 2}, \quad y(t) = t \mod L
\]

Here, the vertical coordinate \( y(t) \) is taken modulo \( L \) (the vertical period), creating a **cylinder** when we glue the top and bottom. The function \( z(t) = e^{in t / 2} \) then traces out a spiral on this cylindrical surface.

#### Step 4: Riemannian metric
For the Riemannian surface, the metric will depend on how distances are measured on the surface. Since we are working with a surface that has a spiral-like structure, the metric can be given by:

\[
ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2
\]

where \( r(t) \) is the radial distance (which can be fixed, since we are on the unit circle), and \( \theta(t) = n t / 2 \) is the angular component that determines the "rise" of the staircase.

### Conclusion:
The surface defined by \( \sqrt{z^n} \) with the top and bottom identified can create an "infinity staircase" by parameterizing a spiral on a cylindrical (or toroidal) surface, with the angle \( \theta \) increasing linearly with \( t \). The surface will loop infinitely due to the identification, and the square root function introduces multi-valued behavior that creates an interesting geometric structure.

This approach blends complex analysis (through the multi-valued square root) and differential geometry (through the Riemannian metric and identification) to form the infinity staircase.

Okay, so I need to figure out how to create an infinity staircase using the square root of z^n function and by identifying the top and bottom of a surface. Let me start by recalling the key concepts mentioned.

First, the square root of z^n is a multi-valued function because of branch cuts in complex analysis. Taking the square root of z^n would introduce branch points, probably at z=0 and maybe at infinity, depending on n. The Riemann surface for sqrt(z^n) would have multiple sheets to make the function single-valued.

Next, the idea of identifying the top and bottom of a surface. This usually means taking a surface that's like a strip and gluing the top edge to the bottom edge, forming a cylinder. If you then also twist it, you might get a torus or something with a helical structure. But the problem mentions an infinity staircase, which suggests something that ascends infinitely but loops back on itself? Hmm, maybe not a cylinder but a surface that allows for continuous climbing without end. But if we identify top and bottom, maybe that makes it compact? Wait, no—if we take an infinite strip and identify top and bottom, that would actually make it a cylinder. But the term "infinity staircase" makes me think of Penrose stairs, which is an impossible object, but maybe here it's a geometric construction that allows a never-ending staircase through some identification.

The mathematical construction starts by parameterizing z on the unit circle, z = e^(iθ), then sqrt(z^n) becomes e^(i n θ / 2). That makes sense because sqrt(z^n) = z^(n/2) = e^(i n θ / 2). So, this is a function that wraps around the circle at half the rate, but since n is involved, maybe the winding number is n/2. But since we take the square root, this function is double-valued unless n is even. For example, if n is even, say n=2, then sqrt(z^2) = z, but that's only true if we take the principal branch. Wait, no—sqrt(z^2) is actually ±z, so it's still double-valued. So regardless of n, sqrt(z^n) would have two branches. Therefore, the Riemann surface for sqrt(z^n) would have two sheets.

But how does this relate to creating a staircase? Maybe the idea is to use the multiple sheets as different "levels" of the staircase. If you traverse a loop around the branch point, you move from one sheet to another, effectively ascending or descending a step. But since the square root only has two sheets, this would only give two levels. However, if we take higher roots, like cube roots, we get more sheets. Wait, but the problem specifically mentions square roots. So maybe the infinity comes from combining the square root with some periodic identification.

The parameterization given in the construction is f(t) = e^(i n t / 2) with y(t) = t mod L. So, here, t is a parameter that increases without bound, but y(t) is taken modulo L, which makes it periodic. So, this would create a helical path on a cylinder. The z(t) component is moving around the circle with a frequency related to n, and the y(t) is moving upward but looping every L units. So, as t increases, you spiral around the cylinder, going up each time, but since y(t) is modulo L, you end up on the same vertical level after each L interval. Wait, but if y(t) is modulo L, then when t reaches L, y(t) wraps back to 0, so the spiral would connect back to the starting point? That would make the path closed, forming a loop on the cylinder. But how is that an infinite staircase?

Hmm, maybe there's a different way to do the identification. If instead of taking y(t) = t mod L, we identify the top and bottom after some transformation. Alternatively, if the surface itself is constructed such that moving around a certain path in the complex plane leads to an increase in height, but the identification allows this height to loop. So, for each full rotation in the complex plane, you ascend a step, and since the square root function has a branch cut, traversing around the branch point would move you to the next sheet, which could correspond to a step. Then, by identifying the top and bottom sheets, you can create a cyclic structure where ascending each step brings you back to the starting level, but infinitely? Wait, maybe not.

Alternatively, if you have a spiral staircase that, instead of being infinite, loops around a cylinder. But an infinite staircase would require an infinite number of steps. If we take the surface to be infinitely long, but with a periodic identification in the vertical direction, then it's like covering space of a cylinder, which is a helix. But I'm not sure.

Wait, the original problem says "identifying the top and bottom of a surface." If the surface is like a strip with top and bottom edges identified, you get a cylinder. If you have a function that maps points on the cylinder such that going around the cylinder once (changing the angle θ by 2π) corresponds to moving up a step in height. So, maybe parameterizing the height as θ/(2π), which would make each full rotation increase the height by 1 unit. But then, if you identify the top and bottom, you have to make the height periodic. Wait, but that would mean that after increasing the height by L units, you loop back. So, combining the square root function, which might have a double cover, with this height parameter.

Let me think again about the given mathematical construction. They define z(t) = e^(i n t / 2) and y(t) = t mod L. So, as t increases, z(t) rotates in the complex plane with angular speed n/2, and y(t) increases but wraps around every L. So, the path is a helix on a cylinder of circumference L. The staircase would be this helical path, where each "step" corresponds to a certain increase in t. However, if n is chosen such that after one period L in y(t), the angle θ = n t / 2 wraps around multiple times. For example, if n t / 2 = 2π k for t = L, then n L / 2 = 2π k, so L = 4π k / n. Then, after t = L, the angle θ would have increased by 2π k, meaning k full rotations. So, the number of windings around the circle per vertical period L is k.

But how does the square root of z^n play into this? The function sqrt(z^n) is used to parameterize the horizontal component (the circle), and y(t) is the vertical component. But the Riemannian surface here is the cylinder with coordinates (z(t), y(t)). The square root introduces the factor of 1/2 in the exponent, making the rotation slower. Without the square root, z(t) would be e^(i n t), which rotates n times faster. So, by taking the square root, we're essentially halving the winding number.

But how does this create a staircase? Each time you go around the circle (i.e., increase θ by 2π), you would have ascended some height. Wait, but in the parameterization y(t) = t mod L, the height is directly proportional to t. So, if θ = n t / 2, then t = 2θ / n. Therefore, y(t) = 2θ / n mod L. So, for each full rotation (θ increases by 2π), y increases by 2*(2π)/n = 4π/n. So, the vertical rise per rotation is 4π/n. If we set L = 4π/n, then after one vertical period, θ would have increased by 2π*(n/2)*(L)/L) = n/2 * L. Wait, maybe this is getting too convoluted.

Alternatively, if we want that after one full vertical cycle (y increases by L), the angle θ has increased by 2π. Then from θ = n t / 2, t = 2θ / n. So, when θ = 2π, t = 4π / n. But y(t) = t mod L, so if we set L = 4π / n, then at t = L, y wraps back to 0, and θ = 2π. Therefore, each vertical cycle corresponds to one full rotation in the complex plane. So, the mapping is such that moving up L units in y makes you go around the circle once. But with the sqrt(z^n), the rotation is slower.

But how does this staircase work? Each step would correspond to a certain increase in t, hence in y. If we imagine walking along the helix, each full loop around the cylinder (which is height L) corresponds to going up L, but since it's a staircase, each full rotation would be a step. However, the problem mentions an "infinity staircase," which might mean that ascending continues indefinitely, but due to the identification, it's actually finite. Wait, no—if we have y(t) modulo L, then the staircase is periodic, so it's more like a finite staircase that loops, not an infinite one.

Maybe the term "infinity staircase" refers to the Penrose stairs, which is an impossible figure where the stairs forever ascend or descend in a loop. To create a mathematical model of such a structure, we need a non-orientable surface or a surface with a special connection. But how does the square root of z^n help here?

Alternatively, maybe the Riemann surface of sqrt(z^n) is being used. Since sqrt(z^n) has a branch point at z=0 and possibly at infinity if n is odd. The Riemann surface would consist of two sheets if n is even, or maybe more? Wait, sqrt(z^n) has a branch point at 0. The order of the branch point depends on n. For example, sqrt(z^3) would have a branch point at 0 of order 3, but the square root would make it a two-sheeted cover. Wait, actually, the number of sheets is determined by the root. Since it's a square root, regardless of n, it's two sheets. The branch points are at z=0 and z=∞ if n is odd, because sqrt(z^n) = z^{n/2}, which is a multi-valued function if n is odd. If n is even, then z^{n/2} is a single-valued function? Wait, no. For even n, z^{n/2} is still multi-valued because sqrt(z^n) is the same as z^{n/2}, but z^{n/2} is only single-valued if n/2 is an integer, but even then, sqrt(z^n) is still ±z^{n/2}. Wait, no—if n is even, say n=2, then sqrt(z^2) = ±z, which is two-valued. So regardless of n being even or odd, sqrt(z^n) is two-valued. Therefore, the Riemann surface is two-sheeted.

To construct the staircase, maybe we take the Riemann surface and "unroll" it into a staircase. Each time you go around the branch point at 0, you switch sheets, which could correspond to moving up a step. But if we identify the sheets after each loop, creating a cyclic structure, then ascending each step brings you back to the starting point? Hmm, that might not create an infinite staircase.

Alternatively, if the Riemann surface is combined with a vertical component, such that each sheet corresponds to a different height. So, moving from one sheet to the other increases the height, and by appropriately identifying the top and bottom sheets, you can make it loop infinitely. Wait, but if you have two sheets, then you can only have two levels. Unless you have infinitely many sheets. But the square root function only has two sheets.

Wait, maybe the idea is to use the fact that the square root function has a periodic branch cut. So, as you wind around the origin multiple times, you alternate between the two sheets, but each time you go around, you also increase the height. So, for example, going around once, you switch sheets and move up a step; going around again, you switch back and move up another step. But how would that work?

Alternatively, consider the Riemann surface for sqrt(z^n) as a double cover of the complex plane branched at 0 and infinity (if n is odd). If we parameterize this surface, each point on the surface can be represented by (z, w) where w^2 = z^n. So, the surface is defined by w = sqrt(z^n). This is a complex curve, and its real dimension is 2. To visualize it, we can consider the map (z, w) → z, which is a 2-to-1 map except at the branch points.

To create a staircase, we might need to embed this Riemann surface into 3D space with a height function. For example, we could represent each sheet as a different level in the height. So, one sheet is at height 0, the other at height 1. When you cross the branch cut, you move from one sheet to the other, thus changing height. But if we identify the top and bottom sheets, then moving from the top sheet to the bottom would loop the height. But this would require that after moving up and down, you end up where you started.

Alternatively, if we take the height to be a parameter that increases as you go around the branch point. For instance, each time you go around the branch point at 0, you increase the angle θ by 2π, which translates to an increase in height. But since the square root function causes θ to be divided by 2, maybe the height increases by π each time you go around. Wait, let's see. If z = re^{iθ}, then sqrt(z^n) = r^{n/2}e^{i n θ / 2}. So, when θ increases by 2π, the argument of sqrt(z^n) increases by n π. So, if we take the argument as a height parameter, then each full loop around z increases the height by n π. If we then identify heights modulo n π, we get a cylinder where each loop around z corresponds to moving up n π in height, but then wrapping around.

But how does this identification create an infinite staircase? If we don't modulo the height, then it's an infinite spiral. If we do modulo, it's a finite cylinder. The term "infinity staircase" might be a misnomer, or perhaps refers to the fact that on the Riemann surface, you can keep going around indefinitely, each time moving to a different sheet or height, but due to the identification, it's actually finite.

Alternatively, the construction is such that the staircase is infinite in extent but the surface is constructed by connecting each step's top to the next's bottom, creating an infinite loop. But I need to reconcile this with the use of sqrt(z^n).

Maybe the key is that the function sqrt(z^n) has a rotational symmetry that allows the steps to align when connected. For example, if n=2, then sqrt(z^2) = ±z, so the Riemann surface has two sheets. If we connect the two sheets such that moving from one sheet to the other via the branch cut corresponds to moving up a step, then traversing the branch cut would take you to the next step. But with two sheets, you can only have two steps unless you have some identification that loops them. If you identify the top of the second sheet with the bottom of the first sheet, then ascending both steps brings you back to the start, creating a loop of two steps. But that's not infinite.

Alternatively, if n is a multiple of some number, allowing more steps. Wait, but sqrt(z^n) is always two-sheeted. Unless you take a different root. Maybe the user mentioned square root, but perhaps if we take a higher root, but the question specifies square root.

Wait, maybe combining the square root function with a periodic identification in the vertical direction. For example, consider the Riemann surface for sqrt(z^n) as two sheets, each parameterized by z, and we add a vertical coordinate y that increases as you move around the branch point. So, each time you go around z=0, y increases by a certain amount, and by identifying y with y + L, you create a cylinder. Then, the combination of the two-sheeted surface and the vertical coordinate creates a double helix? But how does that form a staircase?

Alternatively, imagine that each sheet of the Riemann surface corresponds to a different step. So, starting on the first sheet, going around the branch point once moves you to the second sheet and increases the height by a step. Going around again would take you back to the first sheet but how does the height change? If the height is tied to the number of times you've gone around, then after two loops, you'd be back on the first sheet but at a higher height. Wait, but how?

Perhaps using the concept of a screw dislocation or a helical structure. The Riemann surface for sqrt(z^n) can be embedded in 3D such that moving around the branch point not only switches sheets but also translates vertically. For example, embedding the Riemann surface as a helicoid, where each rotation ascends by a fixed height. If we identify the top and bottom, meaning after some number of ascents, you return to the starting height, then it's a compact surface. But an infinity staircase would require that you can ascend forever.

But the problem mentions "identifying the top and bottom," which usually implies a compactification. So perhaps the infinity is in the number of steps you can take before looping, but the actual structure is finite.

Alternatively, the infinity comes from the non-compact nature of the Riemann surface. The Riemann surface for sqrt(z^n) is non-compact (unless we compactify it by adding a point at infinity), so combining it with a vertical direction that's also non-compact gives an infinite staircase. But then why identify top and bottom? That would make it compact.

This is a bit confusing. Let's look back at the original problem statement. It says "create an infinity staircase using the square root of z^n function, and considering the idea of identifying the top and bottom of a surface." So the key steps are using sqrt(z^n), which gives a multi-valued function with branch cuts, and identifying top and bottom to create the staircase.

Maybe the surface in question is the graph of the function sqrt(z^n). If you take z in the complex plane, and plot the real or imaginary part of sqrt(z^n) as a height, you get a surface. But how does that relate to a staircase? Alternatively, parameterize the surface with coordinates (Re(z), Im(z), Re(sqrt(z^n))) which would give a 3D surface. The branch cuts would create discontinuities, but by creating the appropriate Riemann surface, you can make it smooth.

Identifying the top and bottom might mean connecting different branches. For example, if you take two copies of the complex plane (the two sheets of the Riemann surface) and glue them together along the branch cut. Then, moving through the branch cut takes you from one sheet to the other. If each sheet is assigned a different height, then traversing the branch cut would move you up or down. But to make an infinite staircase, you'd need infinitely many sheets. However, the square root function only has two sheets.

Wait a minute—this might be a misinterpretation. The problem says "identifying the top and bottom of a surface." If the surface is like a spiral staircase, going up infinitely, identifying top and bottom would mean connecting the highest point back to the lowest, making it a loop. But in reality, an infinite staircase can't be compact. So perhaps the model is such that after a certain number of steps, you return to the starting point, but the path allows for infinite traversal due to the identification.

Another approach: consider the mapping z → sqrt(z^n) as a way to generate a covering space. The square root creates a double cover, and if we compose this with a parameterization that includes a vertical component, we can create a structure that loops after two cycles. For example, each time you go around the branch point, you switch sheets and increase the height. After two cycles, you return to the original sheet but at a higher height. Then, by identifying the height after two cycles with the original height, you create a finite staircase. But again, this is finite.

Alternatively, if we don't compactify the vertical direction, the staircase is infinite, but the problem mentions identifying top and bottom, which implies a compactification. This is a contradiction unless the identification is done in a way that doesn't truncate the staircase but allows infinite ascent.

Wait, maybe the identification is not vertical but horizontal. For example, in the case of a square torus, where opposite edges are identified. But the problem says top and bottom, which are usually vertical.

Wait, here's another thought. If we take the complex plane with the function sqrt(z^n), which has a branch cut, and then we take the Riemann surface which is a two-sheeted cover. If we then take this surface and, instead of treating it as two separate sheets, we "twist" them and glue the top edge of one sheet to the bottom edge of the other. This would create a Möbius strip-like structure if n is odd, but a cylinder if n is even. But how does this create a staircase?

Alternatively, consider the Riemann surface as a spiral. For example, the Riemann surface of the logarithm is an infinite spiral ramp. Each time you go around the origin, you move up a floor. Similarly, sqrt(z^n) can be thought of as a double cover, but if we embed it such that each sheet is offset vertically, then traversing between the sheets would correspond to moving up or down. However, the logarithm's Riemann surface is infinitely many sheets, which allows for an infinite staircase. But sqrt(z^n) only has two sheets.

Wait, perhaps the key is to use the logarithm. Because sqrt(z^n) = z^{n/2} = e^{(n/2) log z}. The logarithm function has an infinite-sheeted Riemann surface, so if we consider sqrt(z^n) in terms of the logarithm, we get an infinite spiral. But no, sqrt(z^n) is still two-sheeted. The exponent (n/2) log z would give a multi-valued function, but since it's multiplied by n/2, maybe that changes the number of sheets. Let me see. If n is even, then n/2 is integer, so e^{i n/2 (θ + 2π k)} = e^{i n θ / 2 + i n π k}. If n is even, then n π k is an integer multiple of 2π, so it's single-valued. If n is odd, then n π k is π k, so it alternates sign depending on k. Therefore, sqrt(z^n) is single-valued if n is even and two-valued if n is odd. Wait, that might not be correct. For example, sqrt(z^2) is two-valued (±z), regardless of n even. Wait, no, z^2 is single-valued, but the square root introduces the two values.

Wait, actually, for any n, sqrt(z^n) has two values. For example, if n=3, sqrt(z^3) has two branches. So regardless of n being even or odd, the square root makes it two-valued. Hence, the Riemann surface is two-sheeted.

So, returning to the original construction. If we model the Riemann surface as two sheets, each parameterized by z, and assign a vertical coordinate y to each sheet. For example, one sheet is at y=0 and the other at y=1. Then, traversing a loop around the branch point would move you from one sheet to the other, effectively changing y by 1. But if you identify y=0 with y=1, then moving from one sheet to the other brings you back to the same y level. That would make the surface a Klein bottle-like structure, but I don't see how it creates a staircase.

Alternatively, instead of two discrete sheets, have the vertical coordinate depend on the angle. For instance, as you move around z=0, the vertical coordinate y increases proportionally to the angle θ. So, parameterizing the surface with coordinates (r, θ, y) where y = θ * h/(2π) for some height increment h. Then, each full rotation increases y by h, creating a helical surface. If we then identify y=0 with y=h, we get a toroidal surface. But this doesn't use the square root function.

But in the problem statement, they use sqrt(z^n). So, maybe the vertical coordinate is related to the argument of sqrt(z^n). Since sqrt(z^n) has an argument of nθ/2, if we let the vertical coordinate be proportional to the argument, then y = nθ/2. As θ increases by 2π, y increases by nπ. If we identify y with y + nπ, then the surface becomes a cylinder with circumference nπ. But this is just a helical surface.

Alternatively, taking y = θ/(2π), so each full rotation increases y by 1. Then, using sqrt(z^n) which has an argument of nθ/2, maybe we can set the height to be proportional to the argument. So y = (nθ/2)/(2π) = nθ/(4π). Then, θ increasing by 2π would increase y by n/2. If we identify y with y + n/2, then after one rotation, y increases by n/2 and wraps around. But this seems arbitrary.

I think I need to formalize the steps given in the problem's construction. They start by parameterizing z on the unit circle, then define f(z) = sqrt(z^n) = e^{i n θ / 2}. Then, parameterizing the staircase by t, with z(t) = e^{i n t / 2} and y(t) = t mod L. So, this is a helix parameterized by t, where as t increases, you move around the circle and up the y-axis. The identification modulo L makes it a cylinder.

The key idea is that the square root function slows down the angular progression (since it's divided by 2), meaning that to complete a full circle in the z(t) component, t needs to go to 4π/n (since e^{i n t / 2} = e^{i 2π} implies t = 4π/n). But y(t) at t=4π/n is 4π/n mod L. If we set L=4π/n, then y wraps back to 0 after one full rotation. So, the vertical height y(t) is synchronized with the angular component, making the staircase have steps that align with the vertical period.

Thus, each "step" of the staircase corresponds to a full rotation in the complex plane, which requires t to increase by 4π/n, and this also corresponds to y increasing by 4π/n before wrapping around. But if L is set to 4π/n, then after each step, you return to y=0. However, this would mean the staircase is a single step that loops, which isn't an infinite staircase.

Wait, maybe the steps are the vertical segments between y=kL and y=(k+1)L for integer k. But with y(t) modulo L, all these segments are identified. So, the staircase is actually a single helical step that connects back to itself. That doesn't sound like a staircase.

Alternatively, maybe each "step" corresponds to a half-rotation in the complex plane. Since sqrt(z^n) requires two loops around the branch point to return to the original value. For example, if you start at t=0, z(0)=1. After t=2π/(n/2)=4π/n, you make one full rotation in the complex plane (since angular speed is n/2), and y(t)=4π/n mod L. If L is set to the height of one step, say h, then each full rotation increases y by h. But how does the identification work?

I think I'm getting stuck here. Let me try to visualize this. Imagine a helix wound around a cylinder. The helix goes around the cylinder as it ascends. If you walk along the helix, you're both rotating and ascending. If we "identify the top and bottom," does that mean connecting the top of the cylinder to the bottom? That would create a torus, but the helix would close on itself. However, in this case, the parameterization given is y(t) = t mod L, so the vertical direction is a circle. The z(t) is also a circle. Therefore, the total space is a torus. The path defined by (z(t), y(t)) is a helical path on the torus. Depending on the winding numbers, this path can be either closed or dense on the torus. If n/2 and L are commensurate, i.e., n/2 is a rational multiple of L, then the path closes after some time; otherwise, it's dense.

But how is this an infinity staircase? Maybe because the staircase can be ascended indefinitely without repeating, if the winding numbers are incommensurate. But on a torus, if the path is dense, it never repeats, so technically, you could climb infinitely. But in reality, the torus is a finite surface, so the staircase is finite but the path on it is infinite in the sense that it never loops.

But the original construction uses sqrt(z^n) to achieve this. The key aspect is that by using the square root, the angular parameter is halved, which allows for the helical path to have a different winding number.

In conclusion, the infinity staircase is constructed as a helical path on a torus (or cylinder), where the horizontal component is given by sqrt(z^n) leading to a slower rotation, and the vertical component is periodic. The identification of the top and bottom (making the vertical direction a circle) allows the path to be endless, hence an "infinity" staircase. The multi-valued nature of sqrt(z^n) corresponds to the different sheets of the Riemann surface, which are incorporated into the helical structure.

Therefore, the construction involves creating a parameterized curve on a cylindrical surface where the horizontal component involves a square root function leading to a multi-valued mapping, and the vertical component is made periodic through identification. This results in a path that spirals indefinitely around the cylinder, creating the illusion of an infinite ascent or descent, much like the Penrose stairs but mathematically consistent through the identification of the surface's top and bottom boundaries.

To create an **infinity staircase** using the square root of \( z^n \), we construct a helical surface on a cylinder by combining the multi-valued behavior of \( \sqrt{z^n} \) with a periodic vertical coordinate. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

### **Construction of the Infinity Staircase**

1. **Define the Complex Function**:
   - Let \( z = e^{i\theta} \) (parameterized on the unit circle).
   - The function \( \sqrt{z^n} = e^{in\theta/2} \) introduces a double-valued structure (two Riemann sheets) due to the square root.

2. **Parameterize the Helix**:
   - Introduce a parameter \( t \) such that \( \theta = t \), and define:
     \[
     z(t) = e^{in t / 2}, \quad y(t) = t \mod L
     \]
   - Here, \( z(t) \) rotates in the complex plane with angular speed \( n/2 \), while \( y(t) \) ascends linearly but wraps modulo \( L \), forming a helix on a cylinder.

3. **Identify Top and Bottom**:
   - By taking \( y(t) \mod L \), the vertical direction becomes a circle (periodic boundary condition). This glues the top (\( y = L \)) and bottom (\( y = 0 \)) of the cylinder, allowing infinite traversal.

4. **Riemannian Metric**:
   - The metric on the cylindrical surface is:
     \[
     ds^2 = dr^2 + r^2 d\theta^2 + dy^2,
     \]
     where \( r = 1 \) (unit circle). The vertical term \( dy^2 \) accounts for the staircase's height.

5. **Multi-Valued Behavior**:
   - Traversing \( \theta \) by \( 2\pi \) (one loop around the circle) corresponds to \( t = \frac{4\pi}{n} \), ascending \( \Delta y = \frac{4\pi}{n} \mod L \). If \( L = \frac{4\pi}{n} \), each full rotation aligns with one vertical period, creating seamless steps.

### **Visualization**
- **Horizontal Motion**: The curve \( z(t) \) spirals around the cylinder with \( n/2 \) rotations per vertical period \( L \).
- **Vertical Motion**: The helix ascends indefinitely, but due to \( y(t) \mod L \), it appears as a repeating staircase on the compact cylinder.

### **Conclusion**
The infinity staircase arises from the interplay between:
1. The multi-valued \( \sqrt{z^n} \), which splits the complex plane into two sheets.
2. The periodic vertical identification, creating a closed cylindrical surface.
3. The helical parameterization, which merges rotational and vertical motion into an endless climb.

This structure embodies a **geometric realization of the Penrose stairs**, where the staircase loops eternally due to topological identification, while the square root function ensures a consistent, multi-sheeted ascent.
